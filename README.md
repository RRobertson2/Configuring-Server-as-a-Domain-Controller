# Configuring-Server-as-a-Domain-Controller

### Objective
This project demonstrates the deployment of a Windows Server 2022 virtual machine on a Proxmox hypervisor using a Dell PowerEdge T130 server. The goal was to configure the server as a domain controller and establish a new Active Directory domain. This hands-on experience highlights fundamental skills in Windows Server management, Active Directory setup, and virtualization.

### Skills Learned
- Configuration of Windows Server 2022 as a domain controller
- Installation and deployment of Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Understanding domain naming conventions and forest structure
- Implementation of Active Directory Certificate Services
- Familiarity with DSRM, NetBIOS, and certification authority configuration

### Tools Used
- Proxmox Virtual Environment
- Dell PowerEdge T130 Server
- Windows Server 2022
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
- Server Manager

### Step 1: Rename the Server for Domain Role
Renamed the default server hostname to DC01 to establish a standardized naming convention for domain controllers (e.g., DC01, DC02, etc.).

Assigning meaningful names improves organization and scalability in multi-domain environments.â€¨Renaming the server triggered a system restart to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Begin Domain Controller Configuration
Initiated the installation of domain controller features using Add Roles and Features from the Server Manager dashboard.

Role-Based and Feature-Based Installation: This option allows you to install Windows Server roles and features on the current VM.<br>

Server Pool Selection: This means selecting the local or remote server you want to configure from a pool of available servers in the Server Manager.<br>

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS): This feature enables the creation and management of a centralized directory for user and computer authentication within a domain.<br>

All other roles were left at their default settings.<br>

### Step 3: Promote Server to Domain Controller
After installing AD DS, proceeded to promote the server to a domain controller.
Converts the standalone server into a domain controller responsible for managing user authentication and enforcing domain policies.<br>

New Forest Creation: Used the internal domain name DOOM.local to establish a new forest, the topmost structure in AD hierarchy.<br>
